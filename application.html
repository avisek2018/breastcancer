<h4> We have did 1 unsupervised learning method Principal Component Analysis to investigate the parameters and used 2 supervised machine learning method k Nearest Neighbor and Logistic Regression
to predict the outcome. </h4>

<h3> What is Logistic Regression? <h3>

<h4>It’s an extension of linear regression where the dependent variable is categorical. It predicts the probability of the outcome variable.
Logistic regression can be binomial or multinomial. In the binomial / binary logistic regression, the outcome can have only two types of values e.g. “Yes” or “No”. 
Multinomial logistic refers to cases where the outcome can have three or more possible types of values (e.g., “good” vs. “very good” vs. “best” ). 
Generally, the outcome is coded as “0″ and “1″ in binary logistic regression. </h4>
